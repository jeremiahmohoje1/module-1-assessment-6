        <h2>More Information</h2>
        <p> Volkswagen Citi Golf is a right-hand drive 5-door hatchback manufactured and marketed by Volkswagen in South Africa from 1984 to 2009 as a facelifted version of the first generation Volkswagen Golf Mk1, which ceased production in Germany in 1983</p>
        <p>The car consumes a lot of fuel, an average of 9.6l per 100 Ks to be exact. It's got 17" wheels</p>
        <p>Powels noted that the demise of the Citi Golf was not brought about by any stuttering in demand. â€œThere is still demand, but it is no longer economically viable to produce any platform that has a production level of 20 000 to 25 000 units a year</p>
